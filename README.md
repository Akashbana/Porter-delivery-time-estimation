Porter, India's largest marketplace for intra-city logistics, is revolutionizing the delivery sector with technology-driven solutions.
This case focuses on leveraging neural networks to accurately predict delivery times, a critical aspect of customer satisfaction in logistics.

Objective:

Analyzing this dataset can provide significant insights into delivery dynamics, efficiency bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities.
The insights obtained can enhance Porter's operational efficiency, ensuring timely deliveries and improving driver-partner allocation.

Assumptions:

Since on-shift partners < busy partners, I am assuming that on-shift partners are available partners for delivery during the time of the order and busy partners are partners who are offline
